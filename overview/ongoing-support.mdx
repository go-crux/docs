Crux isn't a "set it and forget it" platform—**we're your ongoing growth partner**. The monthly fee covers more than software access; it includes continuous customisation and strategic support to ensure your analytics evolve with your business.

## What's Included Monthly

### 7 Hours of Customisation & Analysis

Every month includes **7 hours** for:

**How clients typically use monthly hours:**

- **Reactive** (40%): "CAC spiked last week—can you investigate what drove it?"
- **Proactive** (35%): "Add cohort analysis segmented by first-order product category"
- **Strategic** (25%): "Which channels have the highest 90-day LTV customers?"

<Tip>
Pro tip: Schedule a recurring monthly call (30-60 mins) to review priorities and surface questions. This ensures you're using your allocation strategically rather than reactively.
</Tip>
