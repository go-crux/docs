## Data & Accuracy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why do Crux numbers differ from Shopify?">
    You may notice small discrepancies between Crux and Shopify for orders and revenue metrics. This is expected and occurs for several reasons:
    
    ### Timing & Attribution Differences
    
    **Order vs Payment Dates**: Crux reports based on order dates, whilst Shopify admin views may display by payment processing dates—creating timing mismatches, particularly around month-end.
    
    **Refund Handling**: Crux calculates net revenue by subtracting refund amounts from gross revenue at the time of order. Shopify displays refunds at the time of the refund.
    
    **Gross Revenue Definitions**: Crux reports on gross revenue as; product sales + shipping charges, before tax, discounts & returns. While shopify defines it as product price * quantity (before taxes, shipping, discounts & returns).

    **Cancelled & Test Orders**: Crux excludes any orders that have a test discount code (provided by you) applied to them as well as any cancelled orders. Shopify will include cancelled orders and orders from all discount codes. 
    
    ### Which Number Should You Trust?
    
    **For strategic decisions: Use Crux.** Our data model is purpose-built for analytical consistency:
    
    - Orders are always attributed to order date (not payment date)
    - Revenue metrics clearly separate gross, net, and refunded amounts
    - Tax is consistently excluded from profitability calculations
    - Attribution logic is transparent and configurable
    
    **For operational reconciliation: Use Shopify.** The Shopify admin remains authoritative for:
    
    - Payment processing reconciliation
    - Fulfilment status tracking
    - Customer service order lookups
    
    <Info>
    Discrepancies are typically less than 1-2% and occur primarily at period boundaries or during refund-heavy periods.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How often does data refresh?">
    **Daily refresh schedule**: All data sources update overnight (typically between 2-4am GMT).
    
    **Yesterday's data is available each morning** when you start your day, enabling consistent morning triage without waiting for intraday updates.
    
    **Real-time data**: Not currently supported. Crux is optimised for strategic decision-making, not real-time operational monitoring. Although this could be offered in the future.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I export data from Crux?">
    **Yes, with full flexibility:**
    
    - All Looker Studio dashboards support CSV/Excel export of visible data
    - Direct BigQuery access available for SQL users (included in your plan)
    - Custom data extracts can be scheduled as part of your monthly hours
    
    Your data warehouse is your data, you own it to do as you wish with it and we never lock you in.

## Onboarding & Implementation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long does onboarding take?">
    **Typical timeline: 2-3 weeks** from kickoff to production dashboards.
    
    **What affects timing:**
    - **Faster (2 weeks)**: Clean data sources, simple COGS structure, standard channel definitions
    - **Slower (3-4 weeks)**: Complex product catalogues, custom attribution requirements, historical data cleanup needed
    
    We'll provide a specific timeline post kickoff call based on your data complexity.
  </Accordion>

    **Required integrations:**

## Platform Comparison

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is Crux different from Triple Whale, Northbeam, or Klar?">
    The key difference is **strategic positioning**: Crux is a growth partnership, not self-service software. Reporting is fully customisable and you own your data within BigQuery to activate and optimise as you wish.
    
    ### vs Triple Whale
    
    **Triple Whale strengths**: Real-time dashboards, mobile app, quick setup.
    
    **Crux advantages**:
    - **Statistical prioritisation**: Automated health indicators vs manual dashboard monitoring.
    - **Full profitability**: CM1/CM2/CM3 with COGS integration vs primarily revenue-focused.
    - **Monthly customisation**: 7 included hours vs DIY configuration.
    - **Strategic support**: Growth partnership vs software subscription.
    
    **Best for**: Brands prioritising real-time operational monitoring choose Triple Whale. Brands needing strategic profitability analysis choose Crux.

    ### vs Northbeam
    
    **Northbeam strengths**: Attribution modelling (MMM + MTA), sophisticated incrementality testing.
    
    **Crux advantages**:
    - **Implementation speed**: 2-3 weeks vs 2-3 months
    - **Transparent methodology**: Statistical indicators vs proprietary black-box models.
    - **Cost efficiency**: From £999/month vs £3,000+ enterprise pricing.

    ### vs Klar
    
    **Klar strengths**: Blended COGS tracking, multi-currency support.
    
    **Crux advantages**:
    - **Strategic partnership**: Included monthly analysis vs self-service.
    - **Advanced analytics**: LTV v Payback analysis, statistical health indicators.
    - **Customisation depth**: Bespoke channel attribution vs standard definitions.
    - **Technical sophistication**: DBT + BigQuery stack vs managed database.

    ### The Crux Philosophy
    
    **We solve root cause problems, not surface-level tooling gaps.**
    
    The issue isn't that brands lack dashboards—it's that fragmented data prevents organisational coherence. Growth, finance, and ecommerce teams can't align when everyone works from different numbers.
    
    Crux delivers the **capability** to triage effectively, not just another dashboard to monitor.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I switch from another platform?">
    **Yes—we regularly onboard clients from other platforms.**
    
    **What makes switching straightforward:**
    - We connect directly to source data (Shopify, GA4, ads platforms)—no dependency on previous vendor's data models.
    - Historical data imports automatically (typically 24+ months).
    - Your team can run both platforms in parallel during transition if desired.
    
    **Migration timeline**: Standard 2-3 weeks, same as new implementations.
