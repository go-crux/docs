## The Problem We Solve

Early-stage ecommerce brands face a fundamental challenge: **fragmented data creates organisational incoherence (chaos)**.

Every morning, operators spend their first hour stitching together data from Shopify, Google Analytics, Meta Ads, Google Ads, and email platforms—just to understand what happened yesterday. Even when the data is then assembled, critical questions remain unanswered:

- Is a 15% drop in conversion rate cause for concern or normal Tuesday behaviour?
- Are growth, finance, and ecommerce teams aligned on what metrics actually matter (& what their definitions are)?
- Which opportunities are being missed whilst reconciling spreadsheets?

For founder-led ecommerce teams, this fragmentation doesn't just waste time—it prevents the strategic focus needed for growth.

## What Crux Delivers

Crux is your **analytics partner** that transforms fragmented ecommerce data into a single source of truth, enabling busy operators to triage business health in 2 minutes every morning without missing growth opportunities.

We solve three core problems:

## Core Features

### Intelligent Health Monitoring

Our statistical health indicator system automatically analyses your key metrics using percentile-based methods and day-of-week seasonality adjustments. Every morning, you immediately see which metrics are performing unusually well or poorly—without manual analysis.

<Info>
Crux compares today's performance only against the same day of week from the past 12 weeks, avoiding false alarms from expected weekly patterns.

### Comprehensive Business Metrics

Track everything from customer acquisition costs and conversion rates to full profitability metrics (CM1, CM2, CM3) with complete attribution across:

- **Marketing Channels**: Paid social, paid search, email, organic, affiliates, influencers.
- **Customer Segmentation**: New vs repeat, subscription vs one-off, by country.
- **Product Performance**: Category-level analysis with COGS integration.
- **Lifetime Value**: 36-month+ cohort tracking for full unit economics understanding.

### Premium Customisation

Your business isn't generic, so your analytics shouldn't be either. Crux includes extensive customisation capabilities:

- **Marketing channel definitions** based on UTMs and discount codes.
- **Influencer campaign tracking** with post-level attribution.
- **Custom profitability calculations** aligned to your specific cost structure.
- **Bespoke reporting** developed and updated as part of your included monthly hours.

## Who Crux Is For

Crux targets **senior operators at early-stage ecommerce brands**:

- **Founders** who need to triage business health quickly whilst wearing multiple hats.
- **Heads of Growth** who require reliable attribution to optimise marketing spend and a clear picture of the growth levers in the business. 
- **Finance Leaders** (CFOs) who need profitability visibility beyond basic revenue metrics within Shopify.

We typically work with early stage ecommerce brands (2-3 years old) who are looking to use analytics and their data as a strategic advantage.
