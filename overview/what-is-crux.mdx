## The Problem We Solve

Early-stage ecommerce brands face a fundamental challenge: **fragmented data creates organisational incoherence (chaos)**.

Every morning, operators spend their first hour stitching together data from Shopify, Google Analytics, Meta Ads, Google Ads, and email platforms—just to understand what happened yesterday. Even when the data is then assembled, critical questions remain unanswered:

- Is a 15% drop in conversion rate cause for concern or normal Tuesday behaviour?
- Are growth, finance, and ecommerce teams aligned on what metrics actually matter (& what their definitions are)?
- Which opportunities are being missed whilst reconciling spreadsheets?

For founder-led ecommerce teams, this fragmentation doesn't just waste time—it prevents the strategic focus needed for growth.

## What Crux Delivers

Crux is your **analytics partner** that transforms fragmented ecommerce data into a single source of truth, enabling busy operators to triage business health in 2 minutes every morning without missing growth opportunities.

We solve three core problems:

## Three Core Services

### Unified Data Warehouse

Your data from Shopify, Meta, Google Ads, TikTok, GA4 and more flows automatically into your own BigQuery warehouse, already joined, tested for accuracy, and analysis-ready. Reclaim 5-10 hours per week previously spent on manual data wrangling.

- **Your own BigQuery instance**: You own your data completely with full transparency and control.
- **Daily automatic updates**: Yesterday's complete performance waiting every morning.
- **Hundreds of data tests**: Automated checks catch issues before you see them (missing orders, revenue mismatches, date gaps).
- **Enhanced attribution**: Multi-touch attribution combining GA4, Shopify, discount codes and first-party data. Attributes 31% more revenue than standard last-click reporting.

<Info>
All data engineering, transformation and quality testing is handled automatically. You get analysis-ready data without hiring a data team.
</Info>

### Dashboard Suite

Know what needs your attention, instantly, with statistical health monitoring across your complete performance picture. Cut morning triage from an hour to 3 minutes.

- **Intelligent health indicators**: Automatic anomaly detection compares every metric against 12 weeks of same-weekday data. Monday's revenue judged against previous Mondays, not the weekend.
- **True profitability tracking**: COGS, fulfilment fees and payment processing tracked automatically (CM1, CM2, CM3).
- **Complete dashboard coverage**: Business overview, channel performance, Meta, Google Ads, influencer campaigns, customer analysis, LTV & retention.
- **36-month+ cohort tracking**: Full unit economics visibility by channel, product, discount and geography.

<Tip>
Health indicators use four-tier classification (Urgent, Caution, Opportunity, No Action) so you focus on what matters, not normal fluctuation.
</Tip>

### Analysis On Demand

Your analytics team, on demand — without the overhead of a full-time hire. 7 hours monthly of dashboard customisation included, plus strategic analysis services for deeper investigation.

- **7 included monthly hours**: Adapt dashboards as your business evolves (add charts, swap metrics, adjust filters, modify layouts).
- **Ad-hoc investigations**: "Why did CAC spike?" or "Which products subsidise others?" becomes a Slack message, scoped and quoted upfront.
- **Strategic projects**: Value driver audits, predictive CLV modelling, geo-lift tests, and quarterly performance reviews.
- **No surprise invoices**: All analysis work scoped with clear deliverables before work is started.

<Info>
Most early-stage brands don't have 30+ hours monthly of analytics work (i.e. a full time analyst). Analysis On Demand gives you senior-level capacity when you need it, scaling with your business.
</Info>

## Who Crux Is For

Crux targets **senior operators at early-stage ecommerce brands**:

- **Founders** who need to triage business health quickly whilst wearing multiple hats.
- **Heads of Growth** who require reliable attribution to optimise marketing spend and a clear picture of the growth levers in the business. 
- **Finance Leaders** (CFOs) who need profitability visibility beyond basic revenue metrics within Shopify.

We typically work with early stage ecommerce brands (2-3 years old) who are looking to use analytics and their data as a strategic advantage.
