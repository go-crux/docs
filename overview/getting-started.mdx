## Onboarding Timeline

Crux implementation typically takes **2-3 weeks** from kickoff to production dashboards. Here's what to expect:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Week 1: Data Foundation">
    ### Data Access & COGS Implementation
    
    **What we need from you:**
    - Admin access to Shopify, Recharge, GA4, Meta Ads Manager, Google Ads, Bing Ads, & TikTok Ads Manager where relevant.
    - Marketing channel classification rules (how you define "Paid Social" vs "Organic Social").
    - COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) breakdown by product/SKU.
    - Fulfilment cost per order (broken down by order type).
    - Payment processing fee structure.
    - Affiliate marketing costs (if relevant).
    - Influencer posts, costs & follower / category stats.
    
    **What we deliver:**
    - Secure data pipeline setup connecting all sources to BigQuery.

    - Configuration sheet setup for your customisation needs (marketing channels, influencer tracking, discount code tracking).
    
    <Warning>
    Accurate COGS data is critical for profitability metrics. We'll work with you to ensure product costing reflects your actual economics.
