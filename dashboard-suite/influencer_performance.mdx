## Overview

This report delivers comprehensive influencer marketing performance analysis at the individual post level, combining influencer costs, discount code attribution, and complete order tracking across multiple markets.

Data is broken down by date, country, influencer handle, post index, and discount code - enabling you to analyse performance from high-level influencer strategy down to individual post effectiveness. The report automatically identifies "winner" posts using 7-day rolling metrics (posts achieving a defined minimum amount of new orders within a specific CAC threshold), helping you quickly spot top-performing content and influencers worth reactivating or scaling.

Use this report to compare influencer ROI across platforms (Instagram, TikTok), track repeat collaboration performance (post index 1, 2, 3+), analyse new customer acquisition vs. subscription conversion, calculate true profitability including all costs, and identify which influencers and content styles drive the best results for scaling your programme.

## Questions This Report Answers

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="How many post winners have I had over the last 7 days?">
    Use the Post Winners metric to identify posts that have just crossed your winning post criteria. This can be defined as a combination of minimum order quantity and CAC over a specified time range of the post going live (typically first 7 days). These are your proven performers worth reactivating for additional posts or using as benchmarks for evaluating new collaborations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does influencer performance improve with repeat collaborations?">
    Segment by Post Index to compare first posts (index 1) vs. second posts (index 2) vs. subsequent posts. Analyse whether CAC, conversion rates, and subscription adoption improve as influencers become more familiar with your brand and refine their content approach.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the true profitability of each influencer collaboration?">
    Calculate CM1, CM2, and CM3 at the post level to understand profitability after COGS, fulfillment, fees, and influencer costs. Identify which influencers drive profitable growth vs. which deliver high revenue but poor margins after all costs are considered.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does influencer audience size correlate with performance?">
    Analyse Following size vs. CAC, conversion metrics, and profitability to understand if larger influencers deliver proportionally better results. Compare cost per thousand followers (CPM) across different audience sizes to identify the optimal influencer tier for your budget.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which influencers drive the highest subscription conversion rates?">
    Compare Subscription Orders as a percentage of Total Orders across influencers to identify which creators' audiences are most receptive to subscription products. This helps you prioritise influencers who drive higher lifetime value customers rather than just one-off purchases.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How quickly do influencer posts generate results?">
    Track cumulative metrics (Cum 7d New Orders, Cum 7d Cost) over time for individual posts to understand typical performance curves. Identify how many days it typically takes for posts to reach winner status or plateau in performance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does influencer performance vary across markets?">
    Analyse by Country Code to understand geographic performance differences. Compare CAC, subscription rates, and profitability across UK, US, and other markets to optimise influencer selection and content strategy by region.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which team members are building the most effective influencer partnerships?">
    Segment by Owner to compare performance across different team members managing influencer relationships. Identify which managers consistently secure high-performing influencers and apply their best practices across the team.
