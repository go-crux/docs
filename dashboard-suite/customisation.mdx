## Configuration Sheet Overview

The **configuration sheet** is your control panel for customising Crux without touching code. Hosted as a Google Sheet, it provides a user-friendly interface for defining how your business data is classified and attributed.

## What You Can Customise

### Marketing Channel Definitions

Define how traffic sources map to your marketing channels based on UTM parameters and discount codes.

**Use cases:**
- Classify organic social vs paid social based on UTM medium
- Create channel groups (e.g., "Paid Media" encompasses Paid Social + Paid Search)
- Handle edge cases like referral traffic or direct visits

**Example configuration:**

| Channel | Attribute | Operator | Value |
|---------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Paid Social | source_medium | contains | facebook / cpc |
| Paid Social | source_medium | contains | instagram / cpc |
| Paid Search | medium | equals | cpc |
| Email | medium | equals | email |
| Organic Social | source | in | facebook, instagram, tiktok |
| Influencers | discount_channel | is not null | |

<Info>
The `discount_channel` attribute enables discount code-based attribution—perfect for influencer and affiliate tracking where UTMs aren't present.
</Info>

**Supported operators:**
- `equals`: Exact match
- `contains`: Substring match (case-insensitive)
- `starts_with` / `ends_with`: Prefix/suffix matching
- `in`: Multiple value matching (comma-separated)
- `is not null` / `is null`: Existence checking

### Discount Code Attribution

Map discount codes to marketing channels and campaigns for accurate influencer and affiliate attribution.

**Sheet structure:**

| Discount Code | Channel | Channel Group | Campaign | Ad Group | Keyword |
|---------------|---------|---------------|----------|----------|---------|
| INFLUENCE10 | Affiliate Influencer | Influencer | Spring Campaign | Beauty Category | |
| PODCAST15 | Affiliate | Offline | Podcast Tour | | |
| FRIEND20 | Email Partner | Other | Referral Programme | | |

**How this works:**

When a customer uses discount code `INFLUENCE10`, Crux automatically attributes their order to:
- **Channel**: Affiliate Influencer
- **Channel Group**: Influencer
- **Campaign**: Spring Campaign
- **Ad Group**: Beauty Category

This enables tracking influencer performance even when clicks don't include UTM parameters.

### Additional Marketing Costs

Track marketing spend beyond ad platforms—crucial for accurate CAC calculations.

**Typical use cases:**
- Influencer flat fees and gifting costs
- Affiliate network commissions
- Podcast sponsorships
- Traditional media spend
- Agency fees

**Sheet structure:**

| Date | Channel | Channel Group | Campaign | Cost |
|------|---------|---------------|----------|------|
| 2025-01-15 | Affiliate | Offline | Podcast Tour | 500 |
| 2025-01-15 | Affiliate Influencer | Influencer | @beautyguru_uk | 1200 |

These costs integrate into your profitability metrics (CM3, MER) and CAC calculations automatically.

### Influencer Campaign Tracking

Track individual influencer posts with attribution to discount codes for complete ROI visibility.

**Influencer stats sheet:**

| Handle | Name | Category | Country | Followers | Platform |
|--------|------|----------|---------|-----------|----------|
| @beautyguru_uk | Sarah Williams | Beauty | UK | 125000 | Instagram |
| @fitnessdaily | Mike Chen | Fitness | UK | 89000 | TikTok |

**Influencer costs sheet:**

| Date | Handle | Discount Code | Post Index | Cost | Owner | Source |
|------|--------|---------------|------------|------|-------|--------|
| 2025-01-10 | @beautyguru_uk | SARAH10 | 1 | 1200 | Marketing | Story + Feed |
| 2025-01-24 | @beautyguru_uk | SARAH10 | 2 | 800 | Marketing | Story |

**What you get:**

Crux's influencer performance report automatically calculates:
- ROI per post
- CAC by influencer
- Post-level conversion tracking
- "Winner" identification (posts exceeding performance thresholds)
- Repeat collaboration performance (post index 1 vs 2 vs 3+)

<Tip>
Post index tracking helps identify whether influencers perform better on first collaborations or improve with repeat partnerships.

## Configuration Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Simple, Iterate">
    Begin with high-level channel definitions ("Paid Social", "Paid Search") before creating granular sub-channels. 
    
    You can always refine attribution logic as you understand your data better—historical orders will automatically reclassify when rules change.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Document Your Logic">
    Use the configuration sheet comments to note why specific rules exist:
    
    - "Black Friday traffic uses /bfcm/ in campaign name"
    - "Direct traffic with checkout_start source is actually abandoned cart email"
    
    Future you (and your team) will appreciate the context.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test Changes Before Broad Rollout">
    When updating channel definitions that affect many orders, check a sample of recent orders to ensure classification matches expectations before assuming all historical data reclassifies correctly.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Keep Influencer Tracking Current">
    Update influencer costs and discount codes promptly—attribution only works if discount codes are mapped before orders arrive.
    
    Consider blocking a weekly 15-minute admin task for configuration updates.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Customisation (Using Monthly Hours)

### Custom Cohort Dimensions

Beyond standard cohort analysis, create segments like:
- First-order product category (starters vs refills)
- Acquisition discount usage (discounted vs full-price)
- Geographic micro-segments (London vs rest of UK)

### Multi-Touch Attribution

Move beyond last-click attribution with position-based or data-driven models that credit multiple touchpoints in the customer journey.

### Predictive Analytics

Implement CLV prediction models, churn probability scoring, or next-purchase timing forecasts using Machine Learning.
