## Overview

The Paid Search Performance Report is broken down by date, country, platform, campaign type, campaign, and ad group - enabling you to analyse performance from high-level platform strategy down to individual ad group targeting and keywords. Campaign types are automatically classified (Brand, Performance Max, Demand Gen, YouTube, Shopping, Generic) based on naming conventions to help you quickly segment and compare different campaign strategies.

Use this report to compare Google Ads vs. Bing Ads performance, analyse brand vs. non-brand efficiency, optimise budget allocation across campaign types, track new customer acquisition vs. repeat purchases, and calculate true profitability including COGS and fees.
