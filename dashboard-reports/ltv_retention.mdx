## Overview

This report is built from customer cohorts based on the month a customer placed their first order. 
These cohorts are then 'sliced & diced' based on; product categories, discount code, country code, order type & marketing channel.
These cohort attributes can then be filtered or compared as segments across the various report charts for analysis.
