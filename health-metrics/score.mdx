title: "Health score"
description: "Understanding the 0-100 health score for granular performance comparison"
---

While health indicators give you a quick visual signal, the health score provides more granular insight into exactly where a metric sits within its historical distribution.

## How the score works

Each metric receives a **health score from 0 to 100** based on its percentile position within the past 12 weeks of same-weekday data.

- A score of **50** means today's value is right at the median—exactly what you'd expect
- A score of **90** means you're outperforming 90% of historical values
- A score of **10** means you're underperforming compared to 90% of historical values

<Info>
For metrics where lower is better (like CAC), the score is automatically inverted. A score of 90 always means "performing well" regardless of whether high or low values are desirable.

## Score ranges

| Score | Interpretation | Typical indicator |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **90-100** | Exceptional performance | 🟢 Opportunity |
| **70-89** | Good performance | No indicator |
| **50-69** | Normal performance | No indicator |
| **35-49** | Below average | No indicator |
| **20-34** | Poor performance | ⚠️ Caution |
| **0-19** | Critical | ⛔️ Urgent |

## When to use the score

The health score is particularly useful when:

  </Card>
  <Card title="Tracking trends" icon="chart-line">
    A metric moving from 60 to 45 over several days signals a developing issue before it hits "Caution".
  </Card>
  <Card title="Prioritising attention" icon="list-ol">
    When multiple metrics show caution, the score helps you decide which to address first.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reporting to stakeholders" icon="presentation-screen">
    A single number is easier to communicate than percentile bands.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Score vs indicator

The health indicator and health score work together:

- **Indicators** answer: "Does this need my attention right now?"
- **Scores** answer: "How is this performing relative to normal?"

<Tip>
Use indicators for your morning triage—scan of the business health report, looking for ⛔️ and ⚠️ icons. Use scores when you want to dig deeper or compare performance across your entire metric set.
