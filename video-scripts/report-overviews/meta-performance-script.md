## Introduction (30 seconds)

Hi, welcome to this overview of the Meta Performance report. This is your go-to dashboard for analysing Meta Ads performance at the most granular level - right down to individual ads.

The report combines data from three key sources: platform metrics from Meta Ads Manager, session data from GA4, and complete order attribution from your store. This gives you a complete picture of how your Meta advertising drives real business results.

## Key Features (45 seconds)

Let's start with what makes this report powerful.

First, the **Metric Health Report** at the top gives you instant visibility into what's working and what needs attention. Quickly see which metrics are on-track or off-track, so you can prioritise your time on what matters most.

Next, you'll see **Creative Diversification metrics**. This helps ensure you're giving Meta enough creative variety to optimise towards - essential for maintaining strong performance over time.

The data breaks down by date, country, campaign, campaign type, ad set, and individual ad - giving you flexibility to analyse from high-level strategy down to specific creative performance.

---

## Winner Identification Feature (45 seconds)

One of the most valuable features is the automatic **Winner Identification**.

The system flags ads that achieve a CAC 25% lower than the campaign average within their first 7 days, and have spent more than £600 in the last week. These thresholds are customised for each account.

When you spot a winner, you can drill into the creative elements, targeting, and copy to understand what's working - then replicate that success across other campaigns.

Filter by "Is Winner First Time" to see newly successful ads that deserve immediate attention for scaling.

## Ad Age & Creative Fatigue (30 seconds)

The report includes sophisticated **Ad Age tracking** - but it's smarter than just counting days. It only counts days when the ad actually had impressions, giving you a true picture of active ad lifespan.

Use this to track creative fatigue. Compare CPM, CTR, conversion rate, and CAC across different ad ages to identify when ads start declining and need refreshing. This helps you stay ahead of performance drops before they impact your budget.

---

## Campaign Type Analysis (30 seconds)

You can analyse performance across different **Campaign Types** - whether that's Awareness, Advantage Shopping Campaigns, Top of Funnel prospecting, Retargeting, or Testing campaigns.

Compare how you're allocating spend across the funnel and understand how each campaign type influences overall account performance. This is invaluable for optimising your funnel strategy and budget distribution.

---

## Order & Revenue Breakdowns (45 seconds)

Every metric is broken down by customer type and order type.

You can analyse **New vs. Repeat customers** separately - seeing which ads drive acquisition vs. which drive repeat purchases.

You also get **Subscription vs. One-off orders** broken out, so you can identify which creative and targeting drives subscription adoption vs. one-time purchases.

All revenue metrics are available as both Gross Revenue and Net Revenue excluding refunds - giving you the full financial picture with shipping, discounts, refunds, and tax all accounted for.

---

## True Profitability Analysis (30 seconds)

Perhaps most importantly, you can calculate **true profitability** at the ad level.

The report includes CM1, CM2, and CM3 metrics - that's contribution margin after COGS, after fulfilment and payment fees, and after ad spend.

This means you can identify ads that look good on ROAS but are actually unprofitable once you factor in all costs. And conversely, find hidden gems that drive real profitable growth.

---

## Using Filters (30 seconds)

The report is highly filterable.

Segment by **Country** to understand geographic performance differences and optimise your geo-targeting strategy.

Filter by **Campaign Type** to focus on specific funnel stages.

Use **Ad Age** to analyse how performance evolves over an ad's lifetime.

And combine multiple filters to get laser-focused insights - like "winning ads from TOF campaigns in the UK under 7 days old."

---

## Conclusion (20 seconds)

Use it daily to make data-driven decisions about creative, budget allocation, and campaign strategy.
